React Hooks (React > v16.8)

		Functional								Class-based
	Props in, JSX out						Uses props and state
	Great for presentation					Business logic goes in here
	focused on one / few purpose(s)			Orchestrates components

React hooks, me permite usar mas functional components sin usar class components para evitar renders.

JavaScript Functions which can only be used from inside Functional Components or otherHooks
Ej: Named useXYZ()
Idea is to expose certain (possibly stateful) functionalities to functional componentsHooks are highly re-usable and independent for each components
Hooks allow you to add state to functional components and to share (possibly stateful) logic across componets
Have nothing to do with Lifecycle Methods ("Lifecycle Hooks")!
Allow you to use functional components only
Hooks for managing state, side effects (ej Http req) & more
Build custom hooks to share stateful or stateless logic across multiple components
