# React-Hooks

## Functional Components

- Props in, JSX out.
- Great for presentation.
- Focused on one / few purpose(s).

## Class Based Components

- Uses props and state.
- Business logic goes in here.
- Orchestrates components.

(Lifecycle hooks can be hard to use).

## Hooks

- Write all in Functional components.
- Hooks replace class-only functionalities.
- Can only be use in functional components or other hooks.
- Hooks are functions name useXYZ().
- Idea is to expose certain (possibly stateful) functionalities to functional components.
- Hooks are highly re-usable and independent for each component.

- Hooks allow you to add state to functional components and to share (possibly stateful) logic across components.

- React Hook have nothing to do with Lifecycle Methods ("Lifecycle Hooks")!
- Introduced with React 16.8
- Hooks for managing state, side effects (http requests) and more.
- Build custom hooks to share stateful or stateless logic across multiple components.
